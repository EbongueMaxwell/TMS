When considering the perspective of a trainer (or instructor) in a course management system, several key aspects should be taken into account. These perspectives can include their roles, responsibilities, and features that enhance their experience and effectiveness. Here's a breakdown:

1. User Role and Access
Registration and Profile Management: Trainers should have the ability to create and manage their profiles, including personal information, qualifications, and areas of expertise.
Access Levels: Depending on the system's design, trainers may have different access levels compared to students and admins, allowing them to manage their courses and view relevant data.
2. Course Management
Course Creation and Updates: Trainers should be able to create new courses, including defining course content, objectives, duration, credits, and uploading necessary materials (like images and documents).
Edit Existing Courses: They should have the ability to edit course details, update content, and modify schedules.
3. Student Interaction
Enrollment Management: Trainers should be able to view and manage student enrollments in their courses, including accepting or rejecting requests if the system requires approval.
Communication Tools: Features for messaging students, sending announcements, and responding to queries should be available.
4. Assessment and Feedback
